# IN3062 Project SpotifyExperiments

All code can be found in the *'spotify.ipynb'* notebook.

Datasets are all provided in the repository and can also be obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks - except for *'songs_w_genres.csv* as this is a dataset that has been generated by the notebook and is also available in the repository.
